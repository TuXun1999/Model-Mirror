<p>Prologue 
We come from a dark abyss, we end in a dark abyss, and we call the luminous interval life. As soon as we are born the return begins, at once the setting forth and the coming back; we die in every moment. Because of this many have cried out: The goal of life is death! But as soon as we are born we begin the struggle to create, to compose, to turn matter into life; we are born in every moment. Because of this many have cried out: The goal of ephemeral life is immortality! In the temporary living organism these two streams collide ¡­ both opposing forces are holy. It is our duty, therefore, to grasp that vision which can embrace and harmonize these two enormous, timeless, and indestructible forces, and with this vision to modulate our thinking and our action.
The Preparation : First Duty 
 

Do not say, "Draw the curtain that I may see the painting." The curtain is the painting.
With clarity and quiet, I look upon the world and say: All that I see, hear, taste, smell, and touch are the creations of my mind. 
The sun comes up and the sun goes down in my skull. Out of one of my temples the sun rises, and into the other the sun sets.
The stars shine in my brain; ideas, men, animals browse in my temporal head; songs and weeping fill the twisted shells of my ears and storm the air for a moment.
"I do not know whether behind appearances there lives and moves a secret essence superior to me. Nor do I ask; I do not care. I create phenomena in swarms, and paint with a full palette a gigantic and gaudy curtain before the abyss. Do not say, "Draw the curtain that I may see the painting." The curtain is the painting.
To SEE and accept the boundaries of the human mind without vain rebellion, and in these severe limitations to work ceaselessly without protest ¡ª this is where man's first duty lies.
I subdue matter and force it to become my mind's good medium. I rejoice in plants, in animals, in man and in gods, as though they were my children. I feel all the universe nestling about me and following me as though it were my own body.
The Preparation : Second Duty 
 

I am a weak, ephemeral creature made of mud and dream. But I feel all the powers of the universe whirling within me.
I will not accept boundaries; appearances cannot contain me; I choke! To bleed in this agony, and to live it profoundly, is the second duty. 
The mind is patient and adjusts itself, it likes to play; but the heart grows savage and will not condescend to play; it stifles and rushes to tear apart the nets of necessity.
Behind all appearances, I divine a struggling essence. I want to merge with it. 
I feel that behind appearances this struggling essence is also striving to merge with my heart. But the body stands between us and separates us. The mind stands between us and separates us.
Never acknowledge the limitations of man. Smash all boundaries! Deny whatever your eyes see. Die every moment, but say: "Death does not exist."
I am a weak, ephemeral creature made of mud and dream. But I feel all the powers of the universe whirling within me.
I strive to discover how to signal my companions before I die, how to give them a hand, how to spell out for them in time one complete word at least, to tell them what I think this procession is, and toward what we go. And how necessary it is for all of us together to put our steps and hearts in harmony.
To say in time a simple word to my companions, a password, like conspirators.
Yes, the purpose of Earth is not life, it is not man. Earth has existed without these, and it will live on without them. They are but the ephemeral sparks of its violent whirling. 
Let us unite, let us hold each other tightly, let us merge our hearts, let us create ¡ª so long as the warmth of this earth endures, so long as no earthquakes, cataclysms, icebergs or comets come to destroy us ¡ª let us create for Earth a brain and a heart, let us give a human meaning to the superhuman struggle. 
This anguish is our second duty.
The Preparation : Third Duty 
 

Free yourself from the terror of the heart that seeks and hopes to find the essence of things.
 

Where are we going? Do not ask! Ascend, descend. There is no beginning and no end.
